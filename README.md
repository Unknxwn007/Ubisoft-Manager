# Ubisoft Manager
Simple Program to backup & restore savegames and delete compressed screenshots from the Ubisoft Connect Launcher

## Why?
By default the screenshots are compressed, turning on the option to save an uncompressed copy of the image gives you a higher quality screenshot however, it still stores the compressed image. \
Some games don't support cloud syncing and that is annoying, this tool makes sure you never loose your savegames again!

## Goals
- Fix more bugs
